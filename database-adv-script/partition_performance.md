Partitioning Performance Report
Objective
Optimize the performance of large booking queries by partitioning the bookings table based on the start_date.

Initial Performance (Before Partitioning)
Execution Time: 80 ms
Planning Time: 5 ms
Issue:
Sequential scans on the entire bookings table.
Slow performance when querying date ranges.
Improved Performance (After Partitioning)
Execution Time: 0.015 ms
Planning Time: 0.239 ms
Cost: 0.14 to 8.16
Query Plan:
Uses Index Scan on the partition bookings_2025 using idx_bookings_2025_start_date.
The index condition efficiently filters dates between 2025-06-01 and 2025-12-31.
Conclusion
Partitioning significantly reduced execution time from ~80 ms to ~0.015 ms.
Index utilization enhanced query performance by targeting specific partitions.
The overall performance improvement is about 99.98%.
Recommended to continue partitioning for each new year as data grows.
